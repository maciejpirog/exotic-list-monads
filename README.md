# exotic-list-monads

The usual list monad is only one of infinitely many ways to turn the
list functor into a monad. The same applies to the non-empty list
functor. This module collects such exotic "list" monads.

Most of the monads implemented in this library were introduced in the
paper [Degrading lists](degrading-lists.pdf) by Dylan McDermott,
MAciej Pir√≥g, and Tarmo Uustalu (PPDP 2020).
