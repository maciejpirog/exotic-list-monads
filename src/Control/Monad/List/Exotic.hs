-- Module      : Control.Monad.List.Exotic
-- Description : Non-standard monads on the list functor
-- Copyright   : (c) Dylan McDermott, Maciej PirÃ³g, Tarmo Uustalu, 2020
-- License     : MIT
-- Maintainer  : maciej.adam.pirog@gmail.com
-- Stability   : experimental
-- Portability : portable
--
-- The usual list monad is only one of infinitely many ways to turn
-- the List functor into a monad. This module collects a number of
-- such exotic "list monads".
--
-- __Notes:__
--
-- * Types marked with \"(?)\" have not been formally verified to be
-- monads (yet), though they were thoroughly tested (at least 1
-- billion QuickCheck tests each).
--
-- * For readability, code snippets in this documentation assume
-- @OverloadedLists@ and @OverloadedStrings@, which allow us to omit
-- some @newtype@ constructors. Example definitions of joins of monads
-- always skip the @newtype@ constructors.
--
-- * The definitions of monads are optimized for readability and not
-- run-time performance. This is because the monads in this module
-- don't seem to be of any practical use, they are more of a
-- theoretical curiosity.
--
-- * Monads in this module are presented in terms of @join@ rather
-- than '>>='. In each case 'return' is singleton (it is not known if
-- there exist monads on lists with a different return; they exist on
-- non-empty lists though, for example,
--  'Control.Monad.List.NonEmpty.Exotic.HeadTails',
--  'Control.Monad.List.NonEmpty.Exotic.HeadsTail',
--  'Control.Monad.List.NonEmpty.Exotic.IdXList').

-- $finite_presentation
--
-- This section contains monads that come about from free algebras of
-- theories with finite number of operations, represented as type
-- classes. Coincidentally, all theories in this module have one
-- binary and one nullary operation, that is, each is a subclass of
-- "PointedMagma" with additional laws. (So does the usual list monad,
-- where the subclass is monoid.) It is not known if there exist list
-- monads that have a finite presentation but necessarily with a
-- different set of operations.

---------------------
-- Pointed magamas --
---------------------

-- | Pointed magmas are structures with one binary operation and one
-- constant. In general, no laws are imposed.
class PointedMagma a where
  eps  :: a
  (<>) :: a -> a -> a

instance PointedMagma [a] where
  eps  = []
  (<>) = (++)

-- | The name of the class stands for __free right-braketed__
-- (subclass of) __pointed magma__. Here's why:
--
-- Most of the monads defined in this module arise from subclasses of
-- 'PointedMagma', in which we do not assume any additional methods,
-- but require the instances to satisfy additional equations. This
-- means that the monad is not only an instance of such a class that
-- defines a type of algebra, but it is /free/ such algebra.
--
-- In particular, we consider theories @c@ in which the equations have
-- the following shapes:
--
-- @
-- x '<>' 'eps'       ==  ...
-- 'eps' '<>' x       ==  ...
-- (x '<>' y) '<>' z  ==  ...
-- @
--
-- Moreover, when read left-to-right, they form a terminating and
-- confluent rewriting system with normal forms of the following
-- shape:
--
-- @
-- 'eps'
-- x '<>' (y '<>' ( ... (z '<>' t) ... ))
-- @
--
-- This class offers a witness that a particular list monad @m@ is a free algebra of
-- the theory @c@. This gives us the function
--
-- @
-- foldRBPM _ (toList -> []) = eps
-- foldRBPM f (toList -> xs) = foldr1 (<>) (map f xs)
-- @
--
-- which is the unique lifting of an interpretation of generators to a
-- homomorphism (between algebras of this sort) from the list monad to
-- any algebra (an instance) of @c@.
--
-- Note that the default definition of 'foldRBPM' is always the right
-- one for right-bracketed subclasses of 'PointedMagma', so it is
-- enough to declare the relationship, for example:
--
-- @
-- instance FreeRBPM [] Data.Monoid.Monoid
-- @
class (ListMonad m) => FreeRBPM m (c :: * -> Constraint) | m -> c where
  foldRBPM :: (PointedMagma a, c a) => (Item (m x) -> a) -> m x -> a
  foldRBPM _ (toList -> []) = eps
  foldRBPM f (toList -> xs) = foldr1 (<>) (map f xs)

instance FreeRBPM [] Data.Monoid.Monoid

------------------------------
-- The Global Failure monad --
------------------------------

-- | A zero semigroup has an associative binary operation and a
-- constant that is absorbing on both sides. That is, the following
-- equations hold:
--
-- @
-- x '<>' 'eps'       ==  'eps'
-- 'eps' '<>' x       ==  'eps'
-- (x '<>' y) '<>' z  ==  x '<>' (y '<>' z)

class (PointedMagma a) => ZeroSemigroup a

-- | The Global Failure monad arises from free zero semigroups. It
-- implements a kind of nondeterminism similar to the usual List
-- monad, but failing (= producing an empty list) in one branch makes
-- the entire computation fail.  Its join is defined as:
--
-- @
-- join xss | any null xss = []
--          | otherwise    = concat xss
-- @
--
-- For example:
--
-- >>> [1, 2, 3] >>= (\n -> [1..n]) :: GlobalFailure Int
-- GlobalFailure [1,1,2,1,2,3]
-- >>> [1, 0, 3] >>= (\n -> [1..n]) :: GlobalFailure Int

-- The Maze Walk monad --
-------------------------

-- | A palindrome algebra is a pointed magma that satisfies the
-- following equations:
--
-- @
-- x '<>' 'eps'       ==  'eps'
-- 'eps' '<>' x       ==  'eps'
-- (x '<>' y) '<>' z  ==  x '<>' (y '<>' (x '<>' z))
-- @
class (PointedMagma a) => PalindromeAlgebra a

-- | Turns a list into a palindrome by appending it and its reversed
-- init. For example:
--
-- @
-- palindromize []       ==  []
-- palindromize \"Ringo\"  ==  \"RingogniR\"
-- @
palindromize :: [a] -> [a]
palindromize [] = []
palindromize xs = xs ++ reverse (init xs)

-- | The Maze Walk monad arises from free palindrome algebras. Its
-- join is defined as:
--
-- @
-- join xss | null xss     = []
--          | any null xss = []
--          | otherwise    = concatMap palindromize (init xss) ++ last xss
-- @
--
-- Intuitively, it is a list of values one encounters when walking a
-- path in a maze.  The bind operation attaches to each value a new
-- "corridor" to visit.  In our walk we explore every such
-- corridor. For example, consider the following expression:
--
-- >>> join ["John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo"] :: MazeWalk Char
-- MazeWalk "JohnhoJPauluaPGeorgegroeGRingo"
--
-- It represents a walk through the following maze (the entrance is
-- marked with \"â¶\"):
--
-- @
--  ââââ¬ââââ
--  âLUâNGOâ
--  ââ´AâIâââ

-- âNHâOâââ
-- ââââ¤RGEâ
--    âââââ
-- @
--
-- First, we take the J-O-H-N path. When we reach its end, we turn
-- around and go back to J, so our walk to this point is J-O-H-N-H-O-J
-- (hence the connection with palindromes).  Then, we explore the
-- P-A-U-L corridor, adding P-A-U-L-U-A-P to our walk. The same
-- applies to G-E-O-R-G-E. But when at the end of R-I-N-G-O, we have
-- explored the entire maze, so our walk is done (this is why we do
-- not palindromize the last element).

-- @
replicateLast :: Int -> [a] -> [a]

-- | The Stutter monad arises from free stutter algebras. Its join is
-- a concat of the longest prefix consisting only of singletons with a
-- \"stutter\" on the last singleton (that is, the last singleton is
-- additionally repeated /n+1/ times for an /n/ fixed in the type). It
-- doesn't stutter only when the init consists only of singletons and
-- the last list is non-empty. The join can thus be defined as follows
-- (omitting the conversion of the type-level 'Nat' /n/ to a run-time
-- value):
--
-- @
-- join xss | null xss

--
-- The 'Stutter' monad is quite similar to 'ListUnfold'. The
